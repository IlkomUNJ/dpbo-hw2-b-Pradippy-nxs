Total Prompts used (int estimate): 2-7 for each method/function made.

Dominant prompt used for (seek solution / implement ideas) : mostly used for guided learning and asking questions for solution. Simpler methods/functions usually require 2-3 questions being how to implement it, am i correct for implementing it, and overall correction. For more complex logic like the timer, and overall store features it usually takes 4-7 prompt questions. But there are some AI Generated code which are the base prompting texts and most cout outputs.
